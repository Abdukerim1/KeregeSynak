✅ **Better Error Messages**
- Added clear error messages that point to TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- Shows specific HTTP status codes
- Distinguishes between different types of errors

✅ **Mock Mode for Testing**
- Set `MOCK_MODE = true` in app.js to test frontend without backend
- Includes sample test data
- Perfect for UI testing while you fix Google Apps Script

✅ **Improved Error Handling**
- HTTP status checking in all fetch requests
- Better console logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

## What You Need to Fix

❌ **Google Apps Script Deployment** (I can't fix this - you must do it)

### The Problem:
Your Google Apps Script URL returns 404 and CORS errors because:
1. The deployment might not exist
2. The permissions might be wrong
3. You might be using an old/invalid URL

### The Solution:
Follow the steps in **TROUBLESHOOTING.md**:

1. Open your Google Apps Script project
2. Go to **Deploy → Manage deployments**
3. Create new deployment:
   - Type: **Web app**
   - Execute as: **Me**
   - Who has access: **Anyone** ← CRITICAL!
4. Copy the new `/exec` URL
5. Update `SCRIPT_URL` in app.js

### Test Your Deployment:
Open this URL in your browser (replace with your actual URL):
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID/exec?action=getTests
```

You should see JSON like: `{"success":true,"tests":[]}`

If you see a login page or error, the deployment is wrong.

## Temporary Workaround

To test the frontend NOW without fixing the backend:

1. Open `app.js`
2. Change line 2 to: `const MOCK_MODE = true;`
3. Refresh the page
4. You'll see 2 sample tests you can interact with

This lets you test the UI while you fix Google Apps Script.
